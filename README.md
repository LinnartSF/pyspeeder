# pyspeeder
A repository for testing different approach to runtime optimization of Python programs

Testing different approaches to speeding up Python programs, e.g. Numba, c-optimization and so on

Things to keep in mind:
- When working with numba and functions that work with lists, it is best to work with numpy arrays instead of Python lists
